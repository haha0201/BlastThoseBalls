# lol what the hell, we arent having this many powerups, too insane, no homing bullets or waves of bullets
# or anything like that. No one is gonna remember what each powerup does, since I only have a 500 pixel space to draw
# the art for the powerup. We could have reload/dmg buffs, a temp maxhp buff, and dmg all enemies on screen powerup, but not
# like 5 different rarities or that crap. Just each one will have a different spawnrate

# there should be different powerup rarities which give different amounts of buffs, and as you go on rarer ones get more common and common ones get more rare
# also Buffs:
