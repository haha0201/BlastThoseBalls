# fine, then the rarities only do a little bit of difference, like instead of 30, 50, 80, 120, 200, more like 30, 35, 40, 45, 50

# and wave of bullets means like instead of shooting 1 bullet, you shoot 2

# and sure, bullet size, yea

# bruh lmfao now I have to make like 5 more arrays since I cant store all of them on one, and legit I'm only gonna add like 3 rarities max
